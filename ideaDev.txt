catergories:

Users first go to home screen where the content of the page is described.

They have the oportunity to register or log in if they already have an account.

When User is first registered he gets a screen in which he should choose catergories which he wants to track.

After that he gets his home screen with all catergories he chose.

User can always add categories by opening the menu and chosing already created category or creating a new one.

When user wants to create a new note he chooses the category and he can add a new note.

Notes are stored in the database for every loged in user.



DB:
Users table - Id, Username, password

Categories - Id, Title,      | Description

CategoryUser - CategoryId, UserId

NoteUser table - noteId, userId

Notes table - Id, Title, Description, Date modified, CategoryId       | Image




notes:

-use delete button as a component and reuse it or better yet use whole note card as a component and reuse it

-when loging out or submiting forms I don't want to let the user be able to go back with browser back arrow button.

-stop long descriptions from overlaping in note.php page

-limit how much of description is shown and hide the rest, only when it is opened in note.php you can see all(should see)
